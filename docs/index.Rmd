### Reminders
Repo is [here](https://github.com/lizallyn/Pinniped-Case-Studies)   
Current working model is in [SocialSeals_v9.R](https://github.com/lizallyn/Pinniped-Case-Studies/blob/main/Models/SocialSeals_v9.R)  
Model Explanation Doc is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VYwdORJUO0BOJdU_s5iarZ0-YnNVYHJXVU9WCOc4RsY/edit#heading=h.wt3ajsmprmsq) (but not updated right now)

### Currently Working On
Getting the salmon bits to at least work, even if they aren't quite right...  
Updating model explanation document  

Picking my brain back up off the floor and managing to focus for more than 30 mins at a time and not cry at work.

### Currently Need Help With



#### *Issue 2: tabled bc it stopped happening???*

Last meeting we talked about how the instantaneous salmon rates would need to be calculated at a shorter time step in order to produce reasonable estimates when the ratio of seals to salmon is high or the total number of salmon is low. Instead of doing that, we talked about just manually calculating the salmon mortality terms on days when the results from the instantaneous process don't make sense.  
So my work-flow right now is:  

* check to see if any of the rates estimated by the rungeKutta function are negative
  + if no, use them to update the relevant variables
  + if yes, assume that no mortality or escape happens in that time step for that species
    + (I was under no impression that this would be a permanent solution)

What's annoying is that right now I'm having an issue where the Chinook are returning utterly nonsense consumption estimates, and they aren't caught by this process because none of the estimated mortality/escape rates are negative. 
The below plot shows salmon (of all species) consumed per seal that went to the gauntlet in each time step. Obviously 100+ salmon per seal doesn't make a lot of sense.
(I know there's weird stuff going on at day 250 too, but that's a separate Sockeye problem.)

```{r, include=FALSE}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lizallyn/Pinniped-Case-Studies/main/Models/SocialSeals_v9.R")

consumed_plot <- melt(data = salmon_consumed, "Seal")
colnames(consumed_plot) <- c("Seal", "Day", "Consumed")
plot_consumed <- ggplot(data = consumed_plot, aes(x = Day, y = Consumed)) +
  geom_point(color = "turquoise")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height=3}
plot_consumed
```

I did some sleuthing, and around day 182 & 194, the estimate for the number of Chinook consumed skyrockets (1000+), even though the number of Chinook in the system is only 5-6. I plotted the Chinook consumption estimate over a range of values for the starting number of Chinook, and there's clearly something weird that happens between 4 and 6.

```{r, include = FALSE}
rungeKutta.ts <- function(Cmax, Nseal, alpha, Ns, gamma, Y, F_catch, M, E, deltat = 1){
  X <- c(Ns, 0, 0, 0)
  K1s <- get_dXdt(Cmax, Nseal, alpha, Ns = X[1], gamma, Y, F_catch, M, E)
  midX <- X + deltat* 0.5 * K1s
  K2s <- get_dXdt(Cmax, Nseal, alpha, Ns= midX[1], gamma, Y, F_catch, M, E)
  midX <- X + deltat * 0.5 * K2s
  K3s <- get_dXdt(Cmax, Nseal, alpha, Ns= midX[1], gamma, Y, F_catch, M, E)
  endX <- X + deltat * K3s
  K4s <- get_dXdt(Cmax, Nseal, alpha, Ns= endX[1], gamma, Y, F_catch, M, E)
  Xsim <- X + deltat * (K1s / 6 + K2s / 3 + K3s / 3 + K4s / 6)
  return(c(C = Xsim[2]))
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3}
plot(x = seq(1, 7, 0.1), 
     y = lapply(seq(1, 7, 0.1), rungeKutta.ts, Cmax = 5, Nseal = 8, alpha = 1, 
                gamma = 0, Y = 0, F_catch = 0, M = 0.0005, E = 0.03, deltat = 1), 
     ylab = "Estimate of salmon consumed", xlab = "Ns input", 
     main = "Cmax = 5, Nseal = 8, alpha = 1, gamma = 0, Y = 0, F_catch = 0, 
     M = 0.0005, E = 0.03, deltat = 1")
```

What am I looking at here? I don't really understand where this could be coming from?

In trying to solve this problem I'm losing confidence in my whole approach to solving this problem. What is the threshold for results that I should consider unusual or worth overwriting? What assumption do I make about the various mortality/escape rates when I calculate them manually? There is probably a better way to do this whole section, but I'm not sure how to start thinking about that?
