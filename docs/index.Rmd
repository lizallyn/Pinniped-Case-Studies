### Reminders
Github Repo is [here](https://github.com/lizallyn/Pinniped-Case-Studies)   
Current working model can be run with a single call to assembleTheLegos() in "assembleTheLegos.R"  
Model Explanation Doc is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VYwdORJUO0BOJdU_s5iarZ0-YnNVYHJXVU9WCOc4RsY/edit#heading=h.wt3ajsmprmsq) (haphazardly updated right now)

### Currently Working On
* Creating a Base Run and making sure it conceptually checks out  
* Making the results of the base run print to this page for easy comparison  
* Constructing a diagnostics recipe script  
* Updating model explanation document  

### Victories
Created this page! Thanks to Emily for the idea!
And added new pages functionality to separate different results summaries
