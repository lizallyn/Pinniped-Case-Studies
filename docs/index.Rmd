### Currently Working On
Picking my brain back up off the floor and managing to focus for more than 30 mins at a time and not cry at work.

### Currently Need Help With
* remembering what to do with the salmon bit
  + currently we have lots of negative salmon bc not evaluated as often as necessary
  + one option was to just kick it out into a manual discrete calculation process if the instantaneous process creates negative salmon
  + currently trying this but it feels kinda wrong???
