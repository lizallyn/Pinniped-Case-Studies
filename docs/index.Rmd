### Reminders
Repo is [here](https://github.com/lizallyn/Pinniped-Case-Studies)   
Current working model is in [SocialSeals_v9.R](https://github.com/lizallyn/Pinniped-Case-Studies/blob/main/Models/SocialSeals_v9.R)  
Model Explanation Doc is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VYwdORJUO0BOJdU_s5iarZ0-YnNVYHJXVU9WCOc4RsY/edit#heading=h.wt3ajsmprmsq) (but not updated right now)

### Currently Working On
Picking my brain back up off the floor and managing to focus for more than 30 mins at a time and not cry at work.

### Currently Need Help With

Right now I'm having an issue where the Chinook are returning utterly nonsense consumption estimates.

```{r, include=FALSE}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lizallyn/Pinniped-Case-Studies/main/Models/SocialSeals_v9.R")

consumed_plot <- melt(data = salmon_consumed, "Seal")
colnames(consumed_plot) <- c("Seal", "Day", "Consumed")
plot_consumed <- ggplot(data = consumed_plot, aes(x = Day, y = Consumed)) +
  geom_point(color = "turquoise")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5}
plot_consumed
```
